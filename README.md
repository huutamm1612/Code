# Medicinal Herb Chatbot & Classifier
This project combines a knowledgeable chatbot with a powerful image classification model to help users identify and learn about various medicinal herbs.
## About The Project
This project addresses the challenge of identifying medicinal herbs and accessing reliable information about them. Many people struggle to distinguish between plants or find trustworthy details about their uses, benefits, and potential side effects.

Our solution provides a two-part system:
1.  **AI Chatbot:** An intelligent conversational agent that answers user questions about medicinal herbs (e.g., "What are the benefits of ginger?", "How do I use turmeric?").
2.  **Image Classifier:** A deep learning model that can identify a medicinal herb from an image uploaded by the user.

### Key Features
* **Interactive Chat Interface:** Ask questions in natural language and receive informative, accurate answers.
* **Herb Image Recognition:** Upload a photo of an herb to get its name and classification.
* **Rich Information Database:** Provides details on herb properties, uses, dosages, and warnings.
* **User-Friendly Web Interface:** A simple and intuitive web app.
